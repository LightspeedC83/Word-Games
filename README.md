# Word Games: 
this is a game where people will try to guess all the possible combinations of words given a series of letters

# To Do:
- DONE: get collections of word repository (10k is sorted by frequency)
- DONE: crude letter picking method
- DONE: generate words with only chosen letters from a given word repository
- remove roman numerals from the 100k word repo
- update the letter choosing system so that it is less random but more succinct
- implement screening system for unlikely words (eg. word that are all consonants)
- implement a word selection system from all possible words (based on frequency --> more common = better preference)
- implement functions, possibly make some stuff oop
- create a basic terminal game where you guess words from the list
- update the game with the crossword style functionality where it stores all the words in a matrix
